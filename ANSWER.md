Q5: i love angelhack code challenge because it is fun and exciting and i dislike the word yab that appears in the phrase
Q5 note: The encoding "11111111110001" can either be interpreted as that for a
space character or "1111111111", "00" and "01", which corresponds to the word
"yab". As the instructions state that the answer should make sense and be
readable, the output of the function was examined by a human to distinguish
between the two cases.
